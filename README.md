## 🚀 What is Urban Pulse?

**Bengaluru Urban Pulse** is a full-stack web platform built to:

- Predict flooding based on real-time weather data 🌧️
- Monitor lake health, track encroachments via satellite data 🛰️
- Visualize urban heat islands and planning patterns 🏙️
- Connect citizens with actionable alerts 🚨
- Provide live dashboards for researchers and civic bodies

Built as part of our final-year major project under KSCST 48th Series Sponsorship 💡

## 🛰️ Features

- 📡 **Real-time flood prediction** using rainfall + terrain data  
- 🌊 **Lake monitoring dashboard** — health, encroachment alerts  
- 🗺️ **Satellite imagery comparisons** from NASA for historical change detection  
- 🧠 **AI-powered land use forecasts** (planned)  
- 🔒 **Authentication + data storage** via Supabase  
- 📊 **Visual analytics** via React + Mapbox + Recharts

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. User hits the dashboard on `urbanpulse.vercel.app` (example)
2. React frontend fetches:
   - Weather data (OpenWeatherMap)
   - Satellite layers (NASA)
   - Real-time lake stats (mock/actual API)
3. Backend (FastAPI) runs prediction models (flood risk, encroachment likelihood)
4. Mapbox renders interactive overlays (heatmaps, lake outlines, rainfall)
5. Output is shown as **insightful charts, alerts, and geovisuals**
